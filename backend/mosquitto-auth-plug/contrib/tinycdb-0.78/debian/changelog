   - fix handling of files >4Gb
   - fix handling of files >2Gb on 32bit platforms (compile with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64)
   - fix file size limit test
   - fix compiler warnings (missing #include)
  * make it multiarch-aware (install libs to /usr/lib/$arch)
  * use dpkg-buildflags for CFLAGS/LDFLAGS
  * update Standards-Version to 3.9.3
  * debhelper 7
  * simplify debian/rules quite a bit

tinycdb (0.77) unstable; urgency=low

  * manpage typo fixes.

  * in win32, close file mapping handle right after MapViewOfFile(),
    instead of doing it in cdb_close().  This eliminates handle leak
    on win32 platform.  And this is how mmap() works on unix, too.
    Thanks to David Boyce for this.

  * also for win32 platform, cdb.c (the utility):
    - open cdb files in binary mode
    - add windowsisms for include files
    Also thanks to David Boyce for the fixes.

  * fixed a bug in _cdb_make_fullwrite() - wrong logic in EINTR
    handling.
    Thanks to Florian Weimer.
    Closes: #511629.

  * install /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libcdb.pc from debian/rules.
    Closes: #446751, #446752.

  * lintian warnings:
    o moved $DH_COMPAT to deban/compat (=4)
    o set Standards-Version: 3.8.0 (no changes needed)
    o fixed "package package" in libcdb1 description (Closes: #442571)
    o s/${Source-Version}/${binary:Version}/

  * released 0.77

tinycdb (0.76) unstable; urgency=low

  * 0.76 release.
    Closes: #342849, #316253, #360129, #383417.
    Also closes: #299026, #344572.

  * manpage spelling fixes, from Claus Assmann <ca+tinycdb (at) esmtp.org>.

  * little mods to allow compiling tinycdb by C++ compiler,
    from Olly Betts <olly (at) survex.com>.

  * use program_invocation_short_name on GLIBC, (modified) patch
    from Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv (at) altlinux.org>

  * manpage fix (cdb_findnext() prototype),
    from Dmitry V. Levin <ldv (at) altlinux.org>

  * (somewhat silly) GCC-4.x "signedness" warnings fix, modified patch
    from Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv (at) altlinux.org>

  * more signed vs unsigned char* fixes in various places

  * Makefile: always build libnss_cdb.so with libcdb_pic.a, no nss-shared
    target: to avoid extra dependency from /usr/lib/.

  * Makefile: use map files for lib*.so, with explicit list of exported
    symbols.  This, in particular, avoids exporting of libcdb symbols by
    libnss_cdb.so.

  * mark all internal routines as internal_function (defined as
    __attribute__((visibility("hidden"))) for GCC)

  * Makefile: add tests-shared, to use cdb-shared for testing

  * Makefile: allow to specify which binary (shared vs static) to install
    in install target, by using INSTALLPROG variable

  * Makefile: pass -DNSSCDB_DIR=... to compiler when building .lo files,
    to allow setting of system config dir (/etc by default) on command line.
    For nss_cdb module.

  * Makefile: use $(CP) instead of cp, to be able to specify `cp' options
    (CP="cp -p")

  * Makefile: ship debian/ files in `dist' target as well, if not only
    for debian/changelog.

  * Makefile: bumped version to 0.76

  * Use unlink(tmpname) + open(O_CREAT|O_EXCL) instead of
    open(O_CREAT|O_TRUNC) when creating the new CDB file.
    And use O_NOFOLLOW if defined.
    This also works around some (probably) possible symlink attacks.

  * Add -p perms option for cdb utility, to specify mode (permission bits)
    for newly created .cdb file (default is 0666&umask(), -p forces the given
    mode).

  * allow tmpname (cdb -t) to be `-', to mean no temp file gets created.
    Also check if tmpname is the same as database name and don't try to
    rename() if it is.

  * rewrite nss_cdb-Makefile a bit: simplify it, and use more sane
    permission scheme for /etc/shadow

  * bumped Debian Standards-Version to 3.7.2 (no changes necessary).

  * fixed a typo in cdb_seek.c, -- it segfaulted if passed NULL dlenp
    pointer.  Thanks Daiki for the patch.  Closes: #383417

  * use MAP_FAILED to test mmap() return value, instead of hardcoded -1.

  * several minor fixes for debian/* files, thanks to Bernhard R. Link.

  * removed libnss_cdb Debian package, for now

  * libcdb-dev replaces tinycdb<0.76

tinycdb (0.75) unstable; urgency=low

  * 0.75 release

  * debian packaging is now back to me.  Thank you Christian for doing
    packaging work for me, it is greatly apprecated.

  * build 4 packages out of the source base:
    - shared library libcdb1
    - development files libcdb-dev
    - utility tinycdb
    - nss module nss-cdb
    Closes: Debian #360129, #316253.

  * rewrote cdb_make_put(CDB_PUT_REPLACE) to a) actually replace *all*
    duplicates, not just the first one, and b) perform real replace,
    by moving tail of .cdb file.  Also, always add new record to the
    end of the file, not to the place where a duplicate was found.

  * add cdb_make_put(CDB_PUT_REPLACE0) to zerofill all duplicates,
    which is faster than CDB_PUT_REPLACE but less accurate as it
    leaves gaps in the file.

  * ship libcdb_pic.a in the -dev package.

tinycdb (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * added another option, CDB_PUT_WARN, to cdb_make_put's
    flags (to allow adding unconditionally but still warn
    about dups), now cdb_make_put seems to be logically
    complete.
  * added and documented -r and -u options for cdb(1)
    command, and made them consistent with -w and -e
    also.
  * reorganized cdb(1) manpage and added changes made to
    cdb command.
  * added version references to manpages (and make them
    autogenerated to simplify maintenance).

    suggested by Liviu Daia <Liviu.Daia@imar.ro>
