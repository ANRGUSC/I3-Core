tinycdb-0.78 2012-05-11

 - bugfix release:
  o fixed >2Gb file size prob on 32bit platform
  o fixed handling of files >=4Gb
  o fixed a few compiler warnings

 - introduce $(LD) and $(LDFLAGS), and also $(CDEFS) in Makefile

tinycdb-0.77

 - bugfix release: manpage typos, portability fixes and the like

 - bugfix: improper logic in EINTR handling in _cdb_make_full_write
   routine which may lead to corruped .cdb file.

tinycdb-0.76

 - new cdb utility option: -p permissions, to specify permission
   bits for the newly created database file.

 - cdb utility, when creating the database, does unlink() of the
   (temp) db file and when opens it with O_CREAT|O_EXCL, instead
   of previous O_CREAT|O_TRUNC w/o unlink() behaviour, and uses
   O_NOFOLLOW flag if available.  This avoids any possible symlink
   race conditions, but is somewhat incompatible with previous
   versions, where it was possible to create temp file beforehand
   with proper permissions.  Together with new -p option (above),
   this isn't that big change.

 - cdb utility now allows to omit temp file usage (with final rename())
   when creating the database, by specifying -t- (`-' as temp file name)
   (or -t the_same_name_as_the_db_file).  Useful if the utility is called
   from a script which does its own rename afterwards.

 - alot of minor code changes to make modern compilers happy (mostly
   signed char vs unsigned char "fixes").  Including additions of
   `unsigned' into common structure definitions in cdb.h - the API
   stays compatible still.

 - several (spelling and other) fixes for manpages.

 - tinycdb is, once again, maintained as a native Debian package.
   Debian package has been split into 4 parts: libcdb1, libcdb-dev,
   tinycdb (the utility) and libnss_cdb.  RPM .spec file now builds
   two packages as well: tinycdb (includes shared library, the utility,
   and nss_cdb module) and tinycdb-devel (development files).

tinycdb-0.75 (2005-04-11)

 - make cdb_make_put(CDB_PUT_REPLACE) to actually *remove*
   all (was only first previously) matching records, by
   rewriting the file.

 - new mode CDB_PUT_REPLACE0, which zeroes out old duplicate
   records

 - fixed fputs() == NULL condition in cdb.c, finally
   (should be < 0, not == NULL)

tinycdb-0.74 (2003-11-04)

 - reworked cdb utility, see manpage for details.  cdb -q now
   prints all matching records by default (incompat change),
   use cdb -q -n XX to return only XXth record if any.
   -m works with -q.

 - there are several new routines (and macros) in library.
   - cdb_seqinit() and cdb_seqstart() to fetch all records
   - cdb_get() to get a pointer to data in internal buffer
   - cdb_{get,read}{data,key}()

 - cdbi_t gone (but still defined).  Use unsigned instead.

 - cdb_findnext() changed

 - fixed a bug in cdb_seek() (EIO instead of getting valid record)

 - added nss_cdb (for passwd, group and shadow databases only)

 - Makefile targets to build PIC code (libcdb_pic.a, required for
   nss_cdb) and shared library (probably not a good idea)

 - Modifications to allow tinycdb to compile under win32,
   by Victor Porton (porton at ex-code.com).
