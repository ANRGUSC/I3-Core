Introduction
------------
The frontend of I3 is a marketplace built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), a Python Web framework that is widely used for websites with large databases. I3 is also built upon the open source code provided by [Digital Marketplace](https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/digital-marketplace), which provided much of the structure and functionality for buying and selling digital products. Digital Marketplace is an implementation of Django.


Overview
--------
The source code for the marketplace, located in [src](https://github.com/ANRGUSC/iotm/tree/master/frontend/src), is grouped into [apps](#Apps) which provide data structures and functionality for a specific component of the marketplace system.

The basic modules of an app are:

 * models.py - defines the main data structures and functionality for a particular app. The fields defined in models are entered in the database as a table. Inherits from Django class [Models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/models/).
 * admin.py - where we register the models so that they can be seen and manipulated by the site 	administrator.
 * views.py - provides functionality to create, retrieve, update, delete, list, and select items from the 	database. Functions can take a request for an html file and render that page with the relevant 	content. Extends a Django [built-in class-based View](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/class-based-views/).
 * urls.py - contains mappings from a url to a function in views that will render the page. See [digitalmarketplace.urls.py](https://github.com/ANRGUSC/iotm/blob/master/frontend/src/digitalmarket/urls.py) for more info.
 
The [digitalmarket](https://github.com/ANRGUSC/iotm/tree/master/frontend/src/digitalmarket) folder contains [settings.py](https://github.com/ANRGUSC/iotm/blob/master/frontend/src/digitalmarket/settings.py) which is generated by [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/settings/), and other files pertaining to the project as a whole. The html files are located in the [templates](https://github.com/ANRGUSC/iotm/tree/master/frontend/src/templates) folder and other files related to adding style and functionality to the webpages are located in [static](https://github.com/ANRGUSC/iotm/tree/master/frontend/src/static). [Manage.py](https://github.com/ANRGUSC/iotm/blob/master/frontend/src/manage.py) points to main().
